                                  Logical Sentence Puzzle README

This program checks whether a sentence is a legal logical sentence or not, and returns the index of the rightmost character in the first substring of the argument that is enclosed by matching parens and which contains no parens. However, it does not achieve to print the truth table. I was having a hard time trying to figure out what the truth table does. I use the syntax of a legal logical sentence to check whether the sentence is a legal sentence or not, and use the lastIndexof to find the character inside the parens. I¡¯d like to thank my classmates who help me a lot on understanding the truth table (although in the end I¡¯m still having some trouble) and what the findMatch returns. Specially Erick who read the whole Standford logical website and explains what he thinks is a Truth Table to me.
